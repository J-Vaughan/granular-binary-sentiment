# granular-binary-sentiment
A working theory for characterizing sentiments on morality.

The main idea is that no matter the subject[^1], one's sentiment can be broken down into for and against by increasing the level of specificity.

[^1]: Some concepts don't apply -- like, you can't say you're "for" or "against" morality itself.
